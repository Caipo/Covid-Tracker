2) Expontial linear regression plot a best fit line that helps with predicting future amount of cases.
3) Plot the shows past cases and shows bestfit line

## Results 
With the data from march 11th, 2020 our ten day predication gave us a estimate of 1031 cases. Uses the data from march 21, we can see that the amount of cases that were recorded was 1281. This gives us an error rate of 20%. This seems bad at first until we compair it with the data of march 20th of which is 1055 cases. So we can conclude that our model is more or less off by a day
